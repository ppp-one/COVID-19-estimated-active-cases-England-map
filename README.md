# COVID-19 estimated active cases England map
 A map which visualises estimated active cases using python, d3.js, and MetricsGraphics.js as a function of time.
 
 Data extracted from <a href='https://coronavirus.data.gov.uk/'>Public Health England (PHE)</a>, filtering only places that were tagged "LTLA" (Lower Tier Local Authority).
 
 Latitude/Longitude for each place guessed via OpenCage Geocoding API using the name provided by PHE - sorry if any are off!
